# story-words

> A Vue-based draggable *thingy* for ESL learners

ESL learners can story telling. Use your favorite sentence structures and images. **Works great on interactive whiteboards.**

## How to use

After adding images and building the app, open `index.html`. Images can be freely dragged and re-ordered as desired.

## Ideas
 * Custom story cubes
 * Grammar order (use images of words)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# Add some images to the `images` folder. (sample images from placehold.it)
# each folder of images will be a single random image.
# filenames are not used and can be anything
npm run imgjson

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
